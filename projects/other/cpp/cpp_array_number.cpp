/*Notes!!!:
	Since each element of the vector is a digit
	of a number, we can use numbers above 9
	to represent things such as a decimal point,
    the precision that a division should go
	to in order to avoid infinite recurring decimals
	that take up too much memory. The first
	element of the array should define if the
	number is posistive or negative. E.g. 
	{-1,2,3,4,5} which is equivalent to -12345.
	There should also be a parameter which tells
	operations the maximum and minimun that
	the stored number should be.
