Notes:

Needs fixing:
    - Modulo

TODO:
    - Additional testing:
        ~ AI prompt to randomly generate expressions: 
        ~ Randomly generate 25 math expressions that have at least 3 terms each, using the operators, 
            {'+','-','/','*','%','!','^','(',')'}, with positive and negative rational numbers that do 
            not necessarily integers. Output the math expressions in plain ascii text format and not 
            rendered latex as this will test a math parser and it cannot accept latex or uncommon unicode symbols.
    - Variables and functions tokenized, substituted and evaluated
    - Tokenize functions and variables
    - Do something for errors
    - UI
